Python-based system builder for constant-pH simulation in Gromacs.

/calibrate  Calibration of dv/dl coefficients.
/dev        Main testing simulation.
/examples   Example simulations for various things (to be) implemented.
/grom       Files to-be-imported for every simulation.
/proteins   Proteins used for simulating/testing/benchmarking.
/pylibs     Python libraries.

TODO:

-Implement multi-state / virtual-sites.

DONE:

-Figure out and add dV/dl calibration stuff.
-Change builder to work with the new clean-cpHMD constant-pH input.
