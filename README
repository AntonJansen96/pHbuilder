Python-based system builder for constant-pH simulation in Gromacs.

/dev        Main testing simulation.
/examples   Example simulations for various things (to be) implemented.
/grom       Files to-be-imported for every simulation.
/pylibs     Python libraries.
/testing    Proteins used for simulating/testing/benchmarking.

TODO:

-Implement multi-state / virtual-sites.

DONE:

-Change builder to work with the new clean-cpHMD constant-pH input.
