<b>Current gromacs-constantph build that can/should be used with pHbuilder is `f981a7a` (clean-cpHMD-branch). </b>

<b>Description</b>
<p>Python-based system builder for constant-pH simulations in Gromacs.</p>

<b>Install instructions</b>
1. If you have a GPU and want to use GPU-acceleration, make sure you first install <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#pre-installation-actions">CUDA</a>.
2. Clone <a href="https://bitbucket.org/berkhess/gromacs-constantph/branch/clean-cpHMD-branch">clean-cpHMD-branch</a>.
3. Install using the instructions <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/install-guide/index.html">here</a>. I personally use the following CMake flags:
`cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DGMX_GPU=CUDA -DGMX_CUDA_TARGET_COMPUTE=60 -DGMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON -DGMX_SIMD=AVX2_256 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/gromacs_constantph`
4. Clone phbuilder (this) repository.
5. Add phbuilder directory to PYTHONPATH by adding `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/phbuilder` to your `~/.bashrc` file (and reload terminal(s)).

<b>Design principles</b>
<p>I hardly use classes for the developing this builder as I don't particularly like them in Python. Instead, I decided to use the shelve module, which allows for storing and loading python data structures in a binary file. Here, this binary file is called 'universe'. The idea is to just store any data structure that might be of value to other builder/analysis functions in this 'universe', whether it be a float or a long list of Residue objects.</p>
<p>To reduce coupling, one thing I think is very useful is the ability to run any command at any stage of the building process. If a function requires a variable that was not added to the universe yet (because some other builder function was skipped), the function will simply prompt the user to input the missing data instead of exiting (any data structure except for d_residues can be manually added this way). </p>
<p>All (encapsulated) gromacs commands executed by the various builder functions will be logged in the "builder.log" file (this is helpful for debugging purposes). </p>

| Reference list of builder functions |
| :------------- |
| `universe.add(varName, value)` <br /> Add variable to universe. |
| `universe.has(varName)` <br /> Check whether variable with varName is in universe. |
| `universe.get(varName)` <br /> Retrieve variable with varName from universe. |
| `universe.defineLambdaType(resname, pKa, atoms, qqA, qqB, dvdl)` <br /> Define a residue-type that you want to use for lambda-dynamics. The `resname` of the residue-type should be four letters, for which the first three are the base name of the residue (e.g. ASP --> ASPH). At least one lambda residue-type should be defined for constant-pH to work. `pKa` is the macroscopic pKa, `atoms` is a list of atoms to be used in the lambda-group, `qqA` and `qqB` are lists of charges on said atoms in states A and B, and `dvdl` is a list containing the dV/dl coefficients (these are specific for each residue/buffer, and depend on the force field used).|
| `universe.inspect()` <br /> Print all the data members stored in universe. This is very useful for debugging or checking the parameters used for building the simulation in question. |
| `protein.process(fname, d_model=1, d_ALI='A', d_chain=[], resetResId=False):` <br /> Processes a .pdb file. This should be the first step in building the simulation. `fname` is the name of the .pdb file, `d_model` is the MODEL number, `d_ALI` is the alternative location indicator, `d_chain` is a list of chains (default = all), and `resetResId` resets the residue numbering. Note that all atoms in the input protein MUST belong to a chain (must have a chain letter), otherwise the building process won't work. |
| `protein.countres(resName)` <br /> Counts and returns the number of residues of a certain `resName`. |
| `protein.add_box(d_boxMargin, d_boxType='cubic')` <br /> Add periodic box. This function encapsulates `gmx editconf`. |
| `add_buffer(ph_bufpdbName="", ph_bufitpName="", ph_bufqqA=[1], ph_bufqqB=[0], ph_bufMargin=2.5, attempts=100000)` <br /> Add buffer particle(s). This function encapsulates `gmx insert-molecules`. Will be skipped if either `ph_constantpH` is False or `ph_QQleveling == 0`. If no custom structure (.pdb) + topology (.itp) are given, the default (built-in) buffer (ion) will be used. If you want to use a custom buffer, you need to also specify the charges `ph_bufqqA` and `ph_bufqqB`. One can optionally set the minimum distance between the buffer particle(s) (themselves) and the protein, as well as the number of insertion attempts for `gmx insert-molecules`. |
| `protein.add_water()` <br /> Solvate the system. This function encapsulates `gmx solvate`. |
| `add_ions(neutral=True, conc=0, pname='NA', nname='CL')` <br /> Neutralize the system and/or add a specified salt concentration (`conc` in mmol/ml) using `pname` and `nname` ion types (default NA and CL). This function encapsulates `gmx genion`. |
| `topol.generate(d_modelFF, d_modelWater, d_terministring="")` <br /> Generate the protein topology. This function encapsulates `gmx pdb2gmx`, and makes sure all protonatable residues are put in their protonated state when `ph_constantpH` is True. `d_modelFF` is the force field, while `d_modelWater` is the water model. `d_terministring` is a string consisting of two letters, specifying how `pdb2gmx` should treat the termini of the (various chains of) the protein. Commonly used: 00 = charged termini (`pdb2gmx` default), 11 = neutral termini, 34 = use this with capped tripeptide.|
| `topol.restrain_dihedrals(resName, atomNameList, Type, phi, dphi, fc)` <br /> Restrain dihedrals of a certain residue. This is an optional step that should be run after `topol.generate()`. `resName` is the residue name, `atomNameList` is a list containing four strings, indicating with four atoms form the dihedral (e.g. `[' OE1', ' CD ', ' OE2', ' HE2']` to restrain the carboxyl dihedral of GLU), and `Type`, `phi`, `dphi`, and `fc` are restraining parameters (see Gromacs manual). |
| `topol.restrain_dihedrals_by_idx(indices, Type, phi, dphi, fc)` <br /> Restrain dihedral between atom indices. This is an optional step that should be run after `topol.generate()`. `Type`, `phi`, `dphi`, and `fc` are restraining parameters (see Gromacs manual). |
| `md.gen_mdp(Type, nsteps=25000, nstxout=0, posres=False, sameSeed=False)` <br /> Generate .mdp file. Possible Types are: 'EM', 'NVT', 'NPT', 'MD'. If `posres=True`, the entire protein will be position restrained (not just COM). If `sameSeed=True`, the same seed will be used for both ld-seed and gen-seed. This is helpful for debugging. If you use energy_minimize(), tcouple(), and pcoule(), this function only needs to be called explicitly to generate MD.mdp.
| `md.gen_constantpH(ph_pH, ph_lambdaM, ph_nstout, ph_barrierE, cal=False, lambdaInit=0.5)` <br /> Generate constant-pH input parameters. Will be skipped if `d_constantpH` is False. This function currently works in four steps: 1) write general constant-pH parameters to MD.mdp, 2) write different lambda group types to MD.mdp, 3) write different lambda residues to MD.mdp, 4) write lambda groups and corresponding atom numbers to index.ndx.  `ph_pH` is the pH of the simulation/buffer, `ph_lambdaM` is the mass of the lambda particle, `ph_nstout` is the output frequency for the lambda_xxx.dat files, `ph_barrierE` is the barrier energy in kJ/mol. `cal` and `lambdaInit` should be left alone unless you're doing a calibration. |
| `md.energy_minimize()` <br /> Generate EM.mdp and perform energy minimization. Encapsulates `gmx grompp` and `gmx mdrun`. |
| `md.energy_tcouple()` <br /> Generate NVT.mdp and perform temperature coupling. Encapsulates `gmx grompp` and `gmx mdrun`. Velocities are generated in this step, and it should not be skipped. |
| `md.energy_pcouple()` <br /> Generate NPT.mdp and perform pressure coupling. Encapsulates `gmx grompp` and `gmx mdrun`. Can sometimes be skipped for small systems to save time. |
| `write.run(gmxPath="/usr/local/gromacs", options="")` <br /> Write executable bash file called run.sh which calls `gmx grompp` and `gmx mdrun` for running the simulation. `options` can be used to specify a string for additional parameters for mdrun such as `-nsteps`. |
| `write.reset()` <br /> Write executable bash file called reset.sh which can be used to clean up / delete all generate files. Proceed with caution! |

<br />

| Reference list of analysis functions  |
| :------------- |
| `analyze.fitCalibration(order=5, compare=[])` <br /> Fit dV/dl coefficients and plot the fit. `compare` can be used to specify different dV/dl coefficients for a comparison. |
| `analyze.glicphstates()` <br /> Analyze pH states in GLIC. |
| `analyze.plotlambda(plotBUF=False)` <br /> Plot lambda trajectories of all lambda coordinates. Also plot buffer trajectory if `plotBUF=True`.|
| `analyze.plotpotentials(pKa)` <br /> Plot the correction and pH potentials for given pKa. Uses lambda_dwp.dat for obtaining the bias potential. |
| `analyze.plotforces(pKa)` <br /> Plot the correction and pH forces for given pKa. Uses lambda_dwp.dat for obtaining the bias potential. |
| `analyze.plothistogram(fname, bins=200)` <br /> Plot histogram for a given lambda_xxx.dat file. |
| `analyze.compareLambdaFiles(namelist)` <br /> Plot (and compare) the data from multiple lambda.dat files. |

<b>Reference list of data members used/stored in universe:</b>
* All data members have either a `d_` or a `ph_` prefix to distinguish them.
* `d_` means it's a general data member while `ph_` means it's specific to some constant-pH functionality.
